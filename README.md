Inspiration
We were inspired by the power of facial recognition and artificial intelligence, and it's potential for future applications in the real world. We were also inspired by candy, because who doesn't like candy? The concept of vending machines that recognize unique individuals can apply in fields other than concessions. For instance, it can identify an individual, the date and time, and dispense an appropriate dosage of medicine for their chronic illness.

What it does
Gimme is essentially a vending machine that can recognize distinct faces. You use your phone to take a selfie, upload it to the gimme website, and select your favorite candy. The machine has access to this information and can identify you and dispense the appropriate candy.

How we built it
Lots of duct tape, wires, and a bajillion lines of code.

Challenges we ran into
Not enough mechanical components to properly build the machine. Interfacing between the arduino and the face recognition server proved to be challenging.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Built the machine anyway even though we were missing a lot of hardware. We didn't have to completely pull an all-nighter

What we learned
Buy hardware in advance next time. Cardboard is really hard to cut.

What's next for gimme
A more well designed prototype.
